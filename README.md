# DSA-main-project
DATA SCIENCE &amp; ANALYTICS main Project

Project was done in following steps:

1. Explorartory Data Analysis: To help identify various aspects of our domain and data ,understand the patterns within the 
   data, detect outliers, develop/find relations among the variables which give key insights.
2. Data Preprocessing: This will be performed on our dataset to improve the accuracy and quality of our dataset which will 
   be suitable for our further analysis which can be done by handling the missing values, addressing the outliers, scaling 
   data if required making it more reliable where we will only select relevant features as needed for the model which will 
   mainly include the data cleaning.
4. Predictive Modeling: It will be done to create accurate models for predicting the physical activites of the user or 
   predict the behaviours/patterns of the users from the input we have. Algorithms like regression,classification will be 
   done so that it will create a better understanding of the user activities.
5. Fine Tuning: Fine-tuning requires tuning hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs. 
   Experiment with different values and monitor the validation performance to find the best combination of hyperparameters.
6. Model Deployment: After developing and fine-tuning a model, the next step is to deploy it so that it can be integrated 
   into systems or applications to make predictions.
